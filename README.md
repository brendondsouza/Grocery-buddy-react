## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This project was built using React in order to make use of reusable components. The two main components are the 'list' component and the 'alert' component. The 'list' component was used to generate each item in the list. The 'alert' component was used to create different alert banners including success and failure alerts. The reusability of the components ensured that the code was clean and concise with the components being rendered as needed. Local storage is used to save the list on the browser. 

## Optimizations

Completed: Added the ability to mark items as complete with a success banner\
Next: Edit in place: Ability to edit the item in the same line that it originally displayed
